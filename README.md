# FastAPI better documentation

We mean better documenation for the programmers.
And by "better" we mean effective, that's what we are
aiming for.

In our opinion the official FastAPI documentation (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
while it has at least the merit of existing, is unfortunately disappointingly poor and
ineffective for us as programmers, and we are probably not alone.
One important reason for it to be ineffective and consequently frustrating is that
it relies too much on examples.

And regarding examples in documenation we very much agree with Leslie Lamport
claim on that when he said: "[specification by examples]...
It's a terrible pragmatic approach!..."
